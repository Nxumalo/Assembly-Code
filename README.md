# Assembly-Code
This is a very simple assembly code 
created by fraser Nxumalo as he studied assmbly code under the roof of his mother starting in the year 2020 A.D in the month of ramamdan, which was officially his first year of research in the fundamentals of the computer science. The low level language of machine code was used to understand the basics of how software worked in the information age. It is very hard to grasp yet with patience and hour's of poundering the meaning of the subject one begins to understands the mechanism's that drive the of the web.
