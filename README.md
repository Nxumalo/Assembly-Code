# Assembly-Code
This is a very simple assembly code 
created by fraser Nxumalo as he studied assmbly code under the roof of his mother starting in the year 2020 A.D in the month of ramamdan, which was officially his first year of research in the fundamentals of the computer science. The low level language of machine code was used to understand the basics of how software worked in the information age. It is very hard to grasp yet with patience and hour's of poundering the meaning of the subject one begins to understands the mechanism's that drive the of the web.

When i was a student at the university of the Western Cape I came across a book called "THE rEVOLUTIONARY GUIDE TO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE" by VITALY MALJUGIN, JACOV IZRAILEVICH, SEMYON LAVIN AND ALEKSANDER SOPIN. This book change my approach in which i saw computer'sit fancinated me from the get go, the source code helped me grasp the language in a way i could never imagine. I am trully grateful to have taken the challenge of the machine code.
