# Assembly-Code
As I studied assembly language in 2020  which was my first year of research in the fundamentals of the computer science. The low-level language of machine code was used to understand the basics of how software worked in the information age. It is very hard to grasp yet with patience and hour's of poundering the meaning of the subject one begins to understands the way programming works.

Fundatmental knowledge
The most basic observation that can be made is Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.

When i was a student at the University of the Western Cape I came across a book called
"THE REVOLUTIONARY GUIDE TO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE" by VITALY MALJUGIN, JACOV IZRAILEVICH, SEMYON LAVIN AND ALEKSANDER SOPIN. 

This book changed my life, in how i saw computers as a scientist, it inspired my thought's to think about the following subject.

The Philisophy of Computer Science.

These were my early ideas about the Internet, and it's immensity. 
Could it be possible to build a Network so complex and yet so similar to DNA. Knowledge that described the most basic forms of programming such a running code that could be directly translated into machine code.Data Structures with so much Gigabytes it would reval a black hole. How was the mathematics influenced the langauge of assembly.  

In order to run the programs, you will need to install ...

DosBox
Masm 8086 The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is an x86 assembler that uses the Intel syntax for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows.

Once you've installed DosBox, you'll need to pass instruction in the DosBox Command Prompt.

$ mount c c:\8086
$ c:

in order to run an assembler program you'' need to pass the following commands.

$ masm name_of_program.asm
followed by the Enter button
$ link name_of_program
followed by the Enter button
$ name_of_program.exe
This will run your program.
